# Mongoose Traveller RPG Tools

The Mongoose Traveller RPG Tools can help you create procedurally generated content for the [Mongoose Traveller tabletop RPG (1st Edition)](https://www.mongoosepublishing.com/rpgs/1st-edition-traveller.html). The Traveller science fiction roleplaying core rulebook was created by Gareth Hanrahan and is owned by Mongoose Publishing. I own nothing.

### Commands
  - planet: Randomly generate a planet according to the rule on page of the core rulebook.
  - help: Call up a help menu that contains these commands.
